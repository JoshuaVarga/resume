            <strong>Umbrellabot</strong>
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A Discord bot for my personal server of over 30 active members that simplifies scheduling and inviting
                people to play games using <strong>Python</strong> and the <strong>Pycord</strong> API.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>Beautiful Soup</strong> and <strong>Requests</strong> Python libraries are used in a
                webscraper that finds game cover art to populate Discord embedded messages.
            </li>
            <li>
                Used <strong>YAML</strong> to define a workflow that uses GitHub Actions to build and deploy the bot as
                a
                <strong>Heroku</strong> app.
            </li>
            <li>
                Utilizes new Discord features such as threads, scheduled events, application commands, cogs, and the bot
                ui kit.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
            <strong>Cellular Automata</strong>
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Simulates any two-state, Moore neighbourhood cellular automaton input in the form of B/S notation in
                <strong>C++</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Graphics are handled by the <strong>Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML)</strong> which is used to
                implement the ability to
                zoom, pan, and change the simulation speed.
            </li>
            <li>
                While paused, users can use the mouse to change the state of cells allowing for unique interactions with
                the simulation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
            <strong>3D Showroom</strong>
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                University project built using <strong>JavaScript</strong> and the <strong>Three.js</strong> library for
                learning lighting
                in computer graphics.
            </li>
            <li>
                Users can select one of three 3D models and observe how they are rendered under different lighting
                conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implemented lights that come from 6 different directions, can be toggled on/off, and have their colours
                changed.
            </li>
            <li>
                To better observe the lightning effects, the model can be rotated along all axes and the camera can
                pan/zoom.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
            <strong>Covid Data Visualizer</strong>
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                University project built using <strong>JavaScript</strong> and the <strong>D3.js</strong> library to
                visualize different covid metrics using a choropleth map.
            </li>
            <li>The map is drawn using GeoJSON data and coloured using data from a Kaggle dataset.</li>
            <li>
                Created a menu for changing metrics and colour schemes using <strong>lil-gui</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Used transitions to interpolate changes to the DOM for easier differentiation between metrics and color
                schemes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
            <strong>Smart Rockets</strong>
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Small application built with <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>SFML</strong> to observe the learning
                process of genetic algorithms.
            </li>
            <li>
                The rockets must learn to navigate around a static obstacle to hit a target and are assigned a fitness
                score based on how close they are to the target and how fast they get there without a collision.
            </li>
            <li>
                Users can alter the population size as well as chromosome size and mutation rate to observe changes in
                learning speed and accuracy.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
            <strong>Snake</strong>
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Used the <strong>SFML</strong> library to recreate the classic game of snake in <strong>C++</strong>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <!-- <h3>
            Notable Coursework
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Wrote <strong>C</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> code to parallelize several
                computationally complex problems such as Erdős' Multiplication
                Table Problem using <strong>MPI</strong> libraries and ran them on Calcul Québec's
                Béluga supercomputer to solve them for large input sizes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Made a fullstack webapp using the <strong>Flask</strong> web framework and a
                <strong>MySQL</strong> database that compiles a list of recipes based on what
                ingredients a user has available.
